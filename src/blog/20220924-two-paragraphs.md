# These Two Paragraphs Will Save Your Job

I am stuck, aren't I? The realization hits me like a mosquito bite on the nose. I should have seen it coming, and that stings even more.

I wasn't stuck an hour ago. I fixed a similar problem yesterday, but now it's different. I took my standard "walk to take my mind off of it." I stared blankly at my screen for so long that my screen went blank. I'm stuck.

I have spent countless hours stuck before, but this time I have a plan. I will write my two paragraphs.

## Win at Life

A month ago I got click-baited by an article on a no-name newsletter with a title like "The 8 Sentences 10xers Use to Win at Life."

I recognized the obvious hogwash, so I scrolled past the career jockey's life story. Near the end, I found the actual message. The advice was simple enough. 

## The Advice

When you realize that you're stuck, write two paragraphs which answer these questions:

1. What was I working on? 
2. How did I get stuck? 

The article ended abruptly; that was the only advice. Clearly it was more useless productivity theater. I considered removing the article from my browser history.

## Why Not?

A week later, I got stuck. I caught myself before I opened Reddit, took a deep breath to dismiss my ego, and opened Notepad instead. Just two paragraphs.

What was I working on?

> I assigned ticket BA-094 to myself this morning. I knew it was the last day of the sprint, but it was similar to BA-093 which I just completed. I started by copying and pasting my solution to BA-093.

One paragraph down, one to go. How did I get stuck?

> The difference was that BA-093 only dealt with one database, where as BA-094 accounts for a list of them. My previous solution didn't work, because the library I used was single-threaded.

## No Big Deal

When I put the last period on the second paragraph, the universe shattered into a glowing mosaic which shifted and undulated until I caught a glimpse of The Ultimate Truth. I closed my laptop and went to eat my lunch, an everything bagel.

When I got back to my cubicle, the quantum wave forms had collapsed like so many kittens exhausted from playtime. Three versions of myself in three different universes each observed a different outcome from my two little paragraphs.

## A Next Step Appeared

In Universe A, I opened my laptop. To my surprise, the answer stared back at me. The words I had written were specific enough that when I read them again, the solution was simply there.

As I wrote before lunch, I had picked one library based on my previous ticket's requirements. I began to search for a different library to handle both issues.

## I Reached Out

In Universe B, I opened my laptop. I was stumped. I barely understood my own words. I realized the best plan wasn't to tackle this alone but to reach out for help.

I was overconfident about the problem space, because I had solved a similar problem. With a clear head I realized that this was out of my league. I copied and pasted my two paragraphs into a Slack message to my coworker. I had heard them talking about this topic last week.

## Righteous Indignation

In Universe C, I opened my laptop. I was stumped. This writing idea was silly. I never saw the amazing programmers down the hall write anything but bit-mashing arcana. I reminded myself never to believe anything on the Internet.

I closed Notepad unsaved, trashing my two paragaphs. I'd wasted 5 whole minutes I could have used to stare at the problem or scroll through Twitter. My ocular HUD told me I had 7 minutes until Meeting 16A, so I closed my laptop again and put on my Meeting Hat.

## Two Paragraphs

In most universes, I have since written 8 more paragraphs. Now I find myself stuck again. I guess I will write two more. What was I working on?
